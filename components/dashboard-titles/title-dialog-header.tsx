/**
 * The dialog header: who and what this record is, and nothing else.
 *
 * The header has been reduced twice, both times because a thing in it was
 * already being said better somewhere below it.
 *
 * First the five-step workflow strip. It shared this row with the identity
 * cards, and the row did not fit: the cards at their `min-w-[11rem]` floor plus
 * the longest status badge need 537px while the column beside the strip is
 * 522px at `xl`, so the badge wrapped to a second line on 3 of 10 records and
 * the header grew from 89px to 119px. The fix was not to shave pixels but to
 * stop the two competing for the row, so the strip moved to the rail — which
 * shows the same progression against the stage the record is actually in.
 *
 * Then the status badge and the detail sentence. Both restated the pinned
 * `StatusBar` a few pixels below them: the badge showed the same stage label in
 * the same tone, and "Legal compiling buyer file and turnover documents" said
 * nothing the stage name "Document Preparation" had not already said. Two
 * surfaces describing one status is the thing this dialog was built to avoid.
 * What is left is a header whose height depends on the identity cards alone.
 *
 * What must *not* be removed is the pair of `sr-only` Radix elements below.
 * They are the dialog's accessible name and description; without them a screen
 * reader announces a dialog with no title.
