        No heading, and no rule above the rows.

        "Lifecycle Progress" labelled a column whose contents are five numbered
        stage names — the one thing in the dialog that needs no label, because
        the rows say what they are before you reach the top of the list. It cost
        a line of vertical space and a second horizontal rule 16px above the
        nav's own border, which is two rules doing one job.

        No "Jump to Current" button either. It existed because the rail used to
        list only the stages already reached, so the current one could be
        scrolled off; with all five always present and the current row marked,
        the way back is the row itself, a few lines up a column that never
        scrolls far.

        Two sizes, not six. The rows were `text-[9px]`, `text-[10px]` and
        `text-[11px]` in one column — the stage number, the date, the "Current"
        pill and the description all a different size, none of them on the
        scale. The stage name is `text-sm` and its supporting line is `text-xs`.

        An upcoming row is dimmed with `text-muted-foreground` on its name
        rather than `opacity-55` on the whole row: opacity takes the border and
        the chevron down with the text, and a stage that has not happened yet is
        unstarted, not disabled.

        It carries no description line. A record sitting in preparation has
        three unstarted stages, and each one used to spend two lines saying what
        it was waiting for — text about a stage, under a stage already named
        directly above it, on the one row a reader is least likely to be
        reading. Hiding the line leaves the unstarted rows as a plain numbered
        index of what is still ahead, which is what the rail is for, and gives
        the reached stages the column's only prose.

        The leading marker is a checkbox in every state — ticked when the stage
        is done, half-filled when it is current, empty when it has not started.
        It carried the stage's number for a while, which made the column an
        index but read as a second control: a filled disc with a "2" in it looks
        like something to press, and it duplicated the number already written
        into "2. Document Preparation" beside it. A checkbox says the one thing
        the marker is for — whether this stage happened — without competing with
        the label, and it is the same vocabulary the preparation sub-steps
        inside the row already use.

        Pending markers use `border-muted-foreground`, not
        `border-muted-foreground/60`. Tokens here are hex, so the slash-opacity
        form compiles to `rgb(#hex / 0.6)` and is dropped by the browser — the
        border then falls back to `--border` at #E2E7EC, which is why every
        unstarted step in this column read as an empty gap.
