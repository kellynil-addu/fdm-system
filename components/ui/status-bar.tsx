/**
 * The status footer of a calling card.
 *
 * Deliberately not a `Badge` in a bar. A badge can only state what a status is;
 * the point of this strip is to state the status *and* the one number that makes
 * it actionable — how much is still owed, which release documents are missing,
 * how long a clearance window has left. So it takes two independent concerns:
 *
 * - `tone` carries the colour, reusing the same vocabulary as `Badge` so a
 *   "Delinquent" strip and a "Delinquent" badge can never drift apart.
 * - `detail` carries the supporting fact, as plain text or as a `progress` bar.
 *
 * `tone` is separate from the caller's domain on purpose. A Billing card and a
 * Legal card pass the same shell and only differ in which status map filled it,
 * which is what lets one card serve both.
