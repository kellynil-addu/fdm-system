 * thing a clerk does not already know:
 *
 * 1. A non-active lifecycle status. An archived client is not a client you
 *    chase documents from, so this has to outrank attention or the bar would
 *    ask for work that should not happen.
 * 2. An incomplete record. A missing TIN or a missing document is something
 *    staff have to chase.
 * 3. The latest activity — context, and the thing that actually changes
 *    between visits.
 *
 * Only one is shown. A bar saying two things is a bar that says neither
 * clearly.
 *
 * Names rather than counts in the detail: "Missing TCT" tells a clerk what to
 * chase, "Missing 1 document" does not. Long lists truncate in the bar.
