/**
 * Guards that stop a system administrator from locking themselves out.
 *
 * During user testing a tester deactivated the shared admin account and the
 * team could no longer sign in ("after testing, cannot login admin anymore").
 * These rules are enforced in the server actions as well as reflected in the
 * UI, so they still hold if an action is invoked directly.
 *
 * The checks are pure functions so the decision logic can be exercised
 * directly. Plain module (no "use server") because a server-action module may
 * only export async functions, and both the actions and the client UI import
 * from here.
